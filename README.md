# Work_Public

The files here are split into three main categories: reinforcement learning projects, computer vision, and then other ML projects. For the reinforcement learning files, the Planner and Controller codes were prepared to train a bot to control and optimize the performance of a character in PyTux Superkart. I experimented with different approaches but focused primarily on reinforcement learning, convolutional networks and Q learning. Some of my work from that project is attached here.

I have also included some of my work at the Columbia University Robotics club in the computer vision folder. I am working on the perception team for our autonomous vehicle and our mate rover. For the autonomous vehicle, we are trying to train the vehicle to detect objects and to act accordingly. For the mate rover, we will be taking images under water, process those images and reconstruct a 3d image/model of coral reefs.

More to be added soon.
