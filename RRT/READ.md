# RRT Path Planning for Robotic Manipulation


Welcome to the RRT Path Planning for Robotic Manipulation project! This project focuses on implementing the RRT algorithm for path planning in order to manipulate a simulated UR5 robot while avoiding obstacles in a cluttered environment. The primary objective is to guide the robot's movement from one location to another without collision.

## Project Description

Manipulation and path planning play a crucial role in the field of robotics, especially in applications like autonomous bin picking and order fulfillment. In this project, I simulated a UR5 robot in the PyBullet physics simulation engine to perform grasping tasks while navigating around obstacles.

### Project Goals

- **1:** Implement the RRT algorithm for path planning to guide the UR5 robot from a start location to a goal location, avoiding obstacles along the way.

- **2:** Enhance the RRT algorithm to account for additional constraints and complexities in the environment while ensuring successful path planning.

- **3:** Refine the RRT algorithm and analyze its performance on hidden test cases. Test cases that fail due to the probabilistic nature of RRT will have a minor impact on the final score.
